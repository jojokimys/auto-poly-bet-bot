## Critical Findings Across All Agents

### Business Viability
- **87.3% of Polymarket wallets show losses** — edge and automation are essential
- **Zero trading fees** on standard markets (politics, sports, entertainment) — only spread costs
- **Top opportunity**: "Bond Strategy" harvesting near-certain outcomes at discount (documented 1800%+ annualized)
- **Revenue models**: Managed fund (2/20), Signal SaaS ($49-$499/mo), Trading Tools Platform ($1.2M ARR potential)

### Technical Stack (Consensus)
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with `apps/web` + `apps/bot` + shared packages
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + Tailwind + HeroUI + Zustand + lightweight-charts + TanStack Table
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes + BullMQ workers + Redis Pub/Sub
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM) + Redis (Upstash)
- **Bot Engine**: Standalone Node.js process with typed EventEmitter, pluggable Strategy interface
- **Blockchain**: ethers.js/viem for Polygon interactions, EIP-712 order signing
- **Deploy**: Vercel (dashboard) + Railway (bot engine) + Neon (PostgreSQL) + Upstash (Redis)

### Polymarket API Summary
- **CLOB API**: `https://clob.polymarket.com` — trading operations
- **Gamma API**: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com` — market metadata
- **WebSocket**: `wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com/ws/` — real-time data
- **Auth**: Two-level (L1 EIP-712 wallet signing → L2 HMAC-SHA256 for trading)
- **Rate limits**: 3,500/10s burst, 36,000/10min sustained for order placement
- **SDK**: `@polymarket/clob-client` v5.2.1

### Risk Framework (Consensus)
- 2% max capital per single trade
- 15% strategy-level stop-loss
- 25% portfolio-level stop-loss
- 20% cash reserve at all times
- Mandatory risk gate before every order execution
- Emergency kill switch in bot control panel

### Recommended Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Core infrastructure, Polymarket API integration, Bond Strategy (lowest risk, fastest revenue)
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-10)**: Dashboard MVP, position tracking, market scanning, backtesting framework
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 11-18)**: AI/ML intelligence layer, advanced strategies (market making, arbitrage, news sniper)
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 19-26)**: Revenue products (signals SaaS, tools platform), multi-user support, scaling
